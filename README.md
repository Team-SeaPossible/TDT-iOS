## About Our Project

  We thought making a habit of picking up trash was very important to protect the Earth. We hope that games using firebase and ML will help you set goals and make a habit of picking up trash.
  
  Our team members are very interested in the problem of marine litter. While researching the data, I learned that marine litter is caused not only by being dumped directly into the ocean, but also by rain and rivers that litter the side of the road.
  
### About the goals we chose
  We chose 13, climate action and 14, life below water. Our team members were very interested in marine pollution and watched a documentary while doing related research. It was about suffering marine life and we learned that the biodiversity of the sea has a big impact on climate change.
